<h2>Contact - Jeevan John</h2>

<p>Greeting Visitor,</p>

<p>I am <strong>Alterlife</strong>, the online presence of <strong>Jeevan John</strong>.</p>

<p>If you wish to communicate with me, close your eyes and relax. Let your mind wander the vastness of the universe and ponder the infinity of time. For in trying becoming one with all that exists, you will loose yourself and cease to exist, while still being. Thus, you shall trancend the boundaries of the physical and we can then proceed to establish an infinite bandwidth connection through the endless void.</p>

<p>Until that happens, thereâ€™s always email: [ <b>jj at alterlife.org </b>].</p>
