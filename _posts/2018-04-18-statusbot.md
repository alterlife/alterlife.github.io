Visit: [Statusbot on Github](https://github.com/alterlife/statusbot) .

Statusbot is a python script that will automatically generate and send status update emails to your manager and team from the data an ICS formatted todo list.

If you use Rainlendar or any similar task management software which saves your todo list to an ICS file, this tool (once properly configured) will generate a status report of pending, wip and completed in the last 'x' days tasks and send it to your manager and team with one click or as a scheduled job.
