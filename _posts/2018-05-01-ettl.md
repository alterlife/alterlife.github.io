A purely client-side English to Tamil transliteration tool.

This file from 2006 was rescued from an old website of mine thanks to the wayback machine. `ETTL` stands for **E**nglish to **T**amil **T**rans**l**iteration.

Type your name in lowercase in the input box to see how it would be written in Tamil. This is a pure Javascript utility. Nothing is uploaded to a server.
